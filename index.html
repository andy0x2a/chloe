                Dear friends, <br>
                <p>It is with great honour and conviction I publicly declare my intent to seek the nomination to become the Conservative Party Candidate for New-Westminster - Burnaby.
                I don’t just want to be your Candidate, I want to be your Member of Parliament. To get there, I need your help.
            </p>
               <p> Born and bred in BC, I am a proud resident of New Westminster. I have been active in my community, working and living in new west and north Burnaby.
                </p>
                <p>Armed with an MBA from university of northern BC and strong business acumen, I am poised to fight for our community's beliefs and values in the House of Commons. As your MP I will engage the community members, celebrate the cultural diversity that makes NWB unique and deliver on promises. Credibility and accountability go hand in hand and I believe there is a time in every persons life when one must step up for one’s values, neighbours, community. It is my time to demonstrate my abilities and rally support for our cause.
                </p>
                <p>But, I cannot do this alone. I need your support!
                I highly encourage you to join the party and get involved! There will be a nomination contest and I need your votes to win. You will be asked to attend the brief meeting; the date and time to be announced!
                </p>
                <p>Your support and involvement is essential to our success this coming election. I will show you the value in this process and how your individual contribution, no matter how small, can make a BIG difference. I will be accessible to you; I will be in the grocery store, on the board walk, at community events and around the community talking and listening to you.
                </p>
                <p>Join the blue wave.
                </p>
                <p>I am passionate, energetic and committed to becoming your MP. This is the time for us to come together and be the change we've craved for so long.
                </p>
                Kind regards,
                <p>______________________________<br>
