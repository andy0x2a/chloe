                    Dear friends, <br>

                    <p>It is with great honour and conviction I publicly declare my intent to seek the nomination to
                        become the Conservative Party Candidate for New-Westminster - Burnaby. I do not solely want
                        to be your Candidate; I want to be your Member of Parliament. But to get there, I need your help.

                    </p>

                    <p> Born and bred in BC, I am a proud resident of New Westminster. I have been active in my
                        community, working and living in New West and North Burnaby since 2009.
                    </p>

                    <p>I am poised and ready to fight for our community's beliefs and values in the House of Commons.
                        As your Candidate and future MP I will engage you, the community members; I will celebrate
                        the cultural diversity that makes NWB unique and I will deliver on promises. Credibility and
                        accountability go hand in hand and I believe there is a time in every persons life when one must
                        step up for one’s values, neighbours, and community.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is my time to demonstrate my abilities and rally support for you, for our cause, for our
                        community.</p>

                    <p>I cannot do this alone. I need your support! I encourage you to join the party and get involved.
                        There will be a nomination contest where your votes will decide who becomes your Candidate. It
                        is your right to attend the Nomination Meeting and I highly encourage you to do so; the date and
                        time of this meeting will be announced when the Nomination has been officially called.
                    </p>

                    <p>Your support and involvement is essential to our success this coming election. It is my duty to
                        show you the value in this process. It is my honour to show you how your individual
                        contribution, no matter how small, can make a BIG difference.
                    </p>

                    <p>I affirm that I will be accessible to you; I will be in the grocery store, on the board walk, at local
                        events and around the community talking and listening to you.
                    </p>

                    <p>I am committed to becoming your Candidate and your future MP for New Westminster -
                        Burnaby. This is the time for us to come together and be the change we have craved for so long.</p>
                    <p>
                        Join me. Vote Chloé Ellis. Because together, we can make a difference.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    Kind regards,
                    <p>______________________________<br>
                        Chloé J. Ellis<br>
                        Your CPC Candidate for New Westminster - Burnaby</p>

                    <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>

                    <p>
                    Chloé Ellis was born in Vancouver, raised in Port Coquitlam and resides in New Westminster. After
                    graduating from Riverside Secondary School, she continued her studies in business and marketing at
                    Langara College.
                    </p><p>
                    While balancing a full time work schedule and a full time curriculum, she earned a Diploma in Business
                    Management in. A year later, in 2012, she graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing
                    Management from Langara College.</p>


                    <p>
                    In 2013 Volume Studio hired her on as a part-time receptionist, and only one month later she was
                    promoted to Manager. During this time Chloé pursued a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA)
                    from the University of Northern BC (where Hon. James Moore, MP is a notable alumni) graduating as
                    the youngest individual in her class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Since 2009 Chloé has been actively involved in the Universities’ Model Parliament Society of BC. As a
                    new comer to the society Chloé began as a CPC Party Representative and charged with recruitment and
                    public awareness. In 2011 Chloé became the Vice President of the Society and worked to develop the
                    Society’s first Sexual Harassment Policy and first Social Media Policy. At the 2015 AGM, both of these
                    policies were officially adopted and forged in the Society’s Constitution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In 2013, Chloé continued to make Society history when she was elected as both the UMP CPC Party
                    Leader, (earning the title of first female Conservative Prime Minister elected in the Society’s forty-one
                    year history,) as well as President of the Society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    She was elected to a rare second term in 2014. She now acts as Past President and enjoys an active
                    advisory role within the Society.

<p>
A five-year resident and homeowner in New Westminster, Chloé Ellis is committed to representing her riding’s interests in Ottawa. Ms. Ellis is currently a Business Development Manager in Vancouver.
